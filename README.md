### About our app
---


Saddle Up is a "dating" app that ensures to find the perfect match for any cowboy looking to find their dream steed.

This group project was created to simulate a production based environment. Jack and Dominic worked on the front-end portions of the app, while Dan, John, and Mike worked on the back-end portions of the app. The two teams were limited to only minor communication and their own code base to simulate starting on a project with no preexisting code, and how to approach debugging and trouble shooting once the two teams began to integrate their work.

As of now, only cowboys can peruse our app, only because horses don't have thumbs.
